\begin{itemize}
	\item OLS performs very badly if the number of regressors is large relative to sample size.
	\item Estimation uncertainty can be a problem
	\item Noise accumulation in PCA

\begin{block}
	{Basic Setup}
	Forecast scalar time series $y_{t+1}$ using $N$-dimensional collection of time series $X_t$ where we observe periods $t = 1, \hdots, T$.
\end{block}

\begin{block}
	{Assumption}
	Static representation of Dynamic Factor Model:
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		y_{t}&\alert{=}& \beta' F_t + \gamma(L)y_t + \epsilon_{t+1}\\
		\alert{X_t} &\alert{=}& \alert{\Lambda F_t + e_t}
	\end{eqnarray*}
\end{block}

\begin{block}
	{``Direct'' Multistep Ahead Forecasts}
	``Iterated'' forecast would be linear in $F_t$, $y_t$ and lags:
	$$y_{t+h}^h = \alpha_h + \beta_h(L) + \gamma_h(L)+ \gamma_h(L)y_t + \epsilon^h_{t+h}$$

    	{Estimation Procedure}
    	\begin{enumerate}
    		\item Data Pre-processing
    			\begin{enumerate}
    			\item Transform all series to stationarity (logs or first difference)
				\item Center and standardize all series
				\item Remove outliers (ten times IQR from median)
				\item Optionally augment $X_t$ with lags
    			\end{enumerate}
    		\item Estimate the Factors
    			\begin{itemize}
    				\item No missing observations: PCA on $X_t$ to estimate $\widehat{F}_t$ 
		\item Missing observations/Mixed-frequency: EM-algorithm
    			\end{itemize}
    		\item Fit the Forecasting Regression
    		\begin{itemize}
    			\item Regress $y_{t}$ on a constant and lags of $\widehat{F}_t$ and $y_t$ to estimate the parameters of the ``Direct'' multistep forecasting regression.
    		\end{itemize}

\begin{block}
	{Main Theoretical Result}
	Moment restrictions on $(\epsilon, e, F)$ plus a ``rank condition'' on $\Lambda$ imply that the MSE of the procedure on the previous slide converges to that of the infeasible optimal procedure, provided that  $N,T \rightarrow \infty$.

		\item Simulated real-time forecasting of eight monthly macro variables from 1959:1 to 1998:12
		\item Forecasting Horizons: 6, 12, and 24 months
		\item ``Training Period'' 1959:1 through 1970:1
		\item Predict $h$-steps ahead out-of-sample, roll and re-estimate.
		\item BIC to select lags and \# of Factors in forecasting regression
		\item Compare Diffusion Index Forecasts to Benchmark
			\begin{itemize}
				\item AR only
				\item Factors only
				\item AR + Factors

   	{Empirical Results}
   	\begin{itemize}
   		\item Factors provide a substantial improvement over benchmark forecasts in terms of MSPE
   		\item Six factors explain 39\% of the variance in the 215 series; twelve explain 53\%  
   		\item Using all 215 series tends to work better than restricting to balanced panel of 149 (PCA estimation)
   		\item Augmenting $X_t$ with lags isn't helpful
